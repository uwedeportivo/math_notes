# Math notes

Collection of math/cs notes and problems written up over the years for my own amusement. Topics are at the undergraduate college level. Normally notes like these would be written with a pencil in a notebook. \LaTeX\  makes it very easy to produce publishing quality typesetting of mathematical texts, so blame LaTeX for this repo. Hopefully others will find some of these useful.

I'm an amateur but that hasn't prevented me from enjoying writing these notes just as not being Michael Jordan has never prevented me from enjoying pickup basketball. Describing and explaining has helped me understand the topics involved. Errors and misunderstandings are solely my fault.
