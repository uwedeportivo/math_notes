\newthought{Proving the existence of n-th root} is the topic of this note.\index{n-th root}

This note is an experiment in including PDF pages. The included PDF pages are scans of handwriting with a fountain pen. The proof is a modification of the proof of the existence of the square root from Chapter 2 of the \textit{Lectures on Real Analysis} textbook\footnote{\bibentry{l√°russon2012lectures}} to the n-th root case.
