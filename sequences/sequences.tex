\newthought{Counting inversions} is the topic of the problem \footnote{\bibentry{zero_one_sequences}} in this note.\index{inversion}

\begin{problem}
You are given a sequence, in the form of a string with characters `0', `1', and `?' only. Suppose there are $k$ `?'s. Then there are $2^k$ ways to replace each `?' by a `0' or a `1', giving $2 ^k$ different 0-1 sequences (0-1 sequences are sequences with only zeroes and ones).
\\
For each 0-1 sequence, define its number of inversions as the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to sort the sequence in non-decreasing order. In this problem, the sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order precisely when all the zeroes occur before all the ones. For example, the sequence $11010$ has $5$ inversions. We can sort it by the following moves: $11010 \rightarrow 11001 \rightarrow 10101 \rightarrow 01101 \rightarrow 01011 \rightarrow 00111$.
\\
Find the sum of the number of inversions of the $2^k$ sequences, $\text{modulo } 10^9+7$.
